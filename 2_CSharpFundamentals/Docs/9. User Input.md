# Capturing User Input from the Console
## Reading User Input from the Commad Line
- Use the statement `Console.ReadLine()` to read user input 
from the command line.

## What are Code Snippets?
- In Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, you can use 
code snippets to add commonly used code to your C# code 
files. Code snippets can make writing program code 
quicker, easier, and more reliable.
- <em>Expansion</em> code snippets are specified at 
specified insertion points.
- <em>Surround-with</em> code snippets are added around 
selected code.
- See [How to insert or surround code with code snippets.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets?view=vs-2022)
- Command line code snippets allow you to reduce the 
amount of typing you have to do in order to call a 
function at the command line.
- For example, instead of typing `Console.WriteLine()`, 
you can type the two letters `cw` and hit `Tab` twice to 
get `Console.WriteLine()`.
- The complete list of code snippets cab be found 
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-code-snippets?view=vs-2022).

## What is the Role of Compiler Warnings
- Warnings, unlike errors, do not cause compilation to fail.
- However, they are suggestions to you by the compiler 
on how to do things better.
- Therefore, it is wise not to ingore them.
