# Variables
1. What <b>variables</b> are.
2. `int` and `string` data types.
3. Variable <b>declaration</b> and <b>initialization</b>.
4. <b>Duplicating</b> lines of code using a keyboard shortcut. 

- A <b>variable</b> is a location used to store some value.
- It must have a name, e.g. userInput.
- It must have a type, e.g. `int`.
- When decalring a variable, you must specify its name and type.
- Once a variable is declared, its <bold>type</bold> cannot be changed.
- Each variable name within a given scope must be unique.
- You cannot assign a value of a different type to a variable.
For example, you cannot assign the number 277 to a variable of type `string`.
- A variable can be decalred/defined without assigning a value to it.
- A variable must be assigned a value before it can be used elsewhere.
- The act of assigning a value to a variable is also called 
<b>intialization</b>.
- Multiple variables of the same type can be declared 
in a single line:

```
int x, y, z;

x = 10;

y = 7;

z = 9;

string s = "home", t = "text", u = "Good.";
```

<b>Note:</b> All C# statements MUST be terminated using a semi colon.
