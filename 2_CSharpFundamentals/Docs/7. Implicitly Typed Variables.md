# Implicitly Typed Variables

## The `var` Keyword
- Instructs the compiler to infer the type of the variable 
at *compile time*. For example:

```
string firstName = "Ben";
int age = 12;
```

can be written as:

```
var firstName = "Ben";
var age = 12;
```

- Note that use of the `var` keyword requires the variable 
to be initialized at the point of declaration:

```
var firstName;	// Compile time error.
```

## Implicitly and Explicitly Typed Variables
```
string lastName = "Doe";	// Explicitly typed.
var middleName = "Joy";		// Implicitly type.
```

- Both ways of declaring variables are valid.
- Use explicit variable declaration if the variable type 
would not be clear to the reader if it were declared 
implicitly.
