# If/Else Conditional Statement
- Allows you to execute some piece of code if 
a specified condition is `true`, and another 
if it is `false`. Example:

```
var userChoice = Console.ReadLine();

if(userChoice == ABC)
{
	Console.WriteLine("User typeed ABC");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("User did not type ABC");
}

Console.ReadKey();
```

- In the above code, after the `if` we must pass in a 
Boolean or an expression that evaluates to a 
Boolean. If the passed in value is `true` or if 
the result of the passed in expression is 
`true` then the code inside the `if` block 
will be executed, otherwise the code inside 
the `else` block will be executed.

## Tasks
1. Implement a running program for the above 
code snippet.
2. Impement a program that checks is the user's 
input is of a certian length and prints a 
message onto the screen is that is the case, or 
prints a different message onto the screen 
if that is nit the case.

## More than two conditions
- This is accomplished by evaluating an 
`if` condition in subsequent `else` statements.

```
if ([condition])
{
	// Code to execute.
}
else if([condition])
{
	// Code to execute
}
else if ([condition])
{	
	// Code to execute
}
.
.
.
else
{
	// Code to execute.
}
```

## Task
Implement an if/else program with more 
than two conditions to evaluate.
