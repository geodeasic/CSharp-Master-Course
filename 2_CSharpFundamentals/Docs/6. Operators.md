# C# Operators
## Basic Operators
The most basic C# operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `++`, `--`.

- The `+` operator can be used to add numbers and also to 
concatenate strings:

```
int a = 10, b = 6;
int total = a + b;

string firstName = "John", lastName = "Thuku";
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

string persons = "people";
Console.WriteLine(total + " " + persons);	// Notice that int and string types are combined to produce a string.
```

### The Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`) Operators
- The `++`, and `--` operators respectively increment and decrement a whole number by 
one.

#### Prefix Increment (`++a`)
- Increment first then use the value.
- The value of `a` is incremented by 1 before it is used by 
any further expressions.
- If `a` is 5, then after `++a;`, the value of `a` becomes 6.

Example:
```
int a = 5;
int b = ++a; // a is incremented to 6, then b is assigned the value 6.
// a = 6, b = 6
```

#### Postfix Increment (a++):
- Use the value first, then increment.
- The current value of `a` is used in the expression, and only after 
that is `a` incremented by 1.
- If `a` is 5, then after `a++;`, the value of `a` becomes 6, 
but the expression a++ itself evaluates to the original value, 
which is 5.

Example:
```
int a = 5;
int b = a++; // b is assigned the value 5, then a is incremented to 6.
// a = 6, b = 5
```

## Operator Precedence
- In C#, each operator has its <b>precedence</b>.
- In an expression with multiple operators, operators 
with higher precedence are evaluated before operators 
with lower precedence.
- You can manipulate the order of operator evaluation by using 
parantheses.
- For more information on operator precedence, see the official documentation
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/#operator-precedence).

```
int a = 10, b = 6;
Console.WriteLine("Addition: " + a + b);	// Valid
Console.WriteLine("Subtraction: " + a - b);	// Invalid
Console.WriteLine("Multiplication: " + a * b);	// Valid
Console.WriteLine("Division: " + a / b);	// Valid

```
