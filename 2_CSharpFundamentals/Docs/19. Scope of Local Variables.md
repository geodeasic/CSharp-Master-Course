# Scopes of Local Variables
Learning objectives:
- Where particular variables can be used 
and where they cannot be used.
- Codes blocks
- Nested `if` statements

## Scope
- Defines a part of a program wherein a partuclar 
variable is accessible.
- The variables in the context of this section 
are called <b>local variables</b>. 
- They are local to the scope.

```
var userInput = Console.ReadLine();

if(userInput.Length == 0)
{
	Console.WriteLine("No user input.");

	int myNumber = 0;
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("The user input is: " + userInput);
	Console.WriteLine(myNumber);
}

Console.WriteLine("You entered: " + userInput);
Console.WriteLine(myNumber);
```

- A vraible can only be used in the scope in which 
it was declared.

## Nested Ifs
- In the following code snippet, is accessible 
both in the outer code block and in the inner 
code block.
```
{
	Console.WriteLine("Empty user input!");
	int number = 5;
	Console.WriteLine(number);
	var greeting = "Hello!";

	if(greeting.Length > 0)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(number);
	}
}
```
- Declaring a variable in a scope in which 
another variable with the same name has been 
declared will raise a compiler error.
