# More about comments
## Learning objectives
- How to add <b>single-line</b> and <b>multi-line</b> 
comments
- Shortcuts for <b>commenting</b> and <b>uncommenting</b> 
code.
- How to write in <b>multiple lines</b> at the same time.

## About comments
- Comments are pieces of text added to source code that 
are ignored by the compiler, i.e., they are neither 
compiled nor executed.
- They are meant for humans reading the code, not 
computers.
- They are merely a way to add some extra information to 
the code.

## Single-line comments
- Comments that do not span more than one line.
- Start with two forward slashes.
- Can be added to a line that already has some code.

```csharp
Console.Write("Please enter your name: ");

// TODO: Capture the user's input.
string name = Console.ReadLine();	// Saves the user's input to a variable.
```

## Multi-line comments
- Comments that span more than one line.
- Start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk.
- End with an asterisk followed by a slash.

```csharp
/* This is a 
   comment spanning 
   more than one line. */
```

- To comment one or more lines of code, select the line(s) of 
code and press `Ctrl + /`.

### Caution
Adding comments should not be an alternative to writing clean, 
high quality code. For example, the following is not 
recommended:

```csharp
string bd; // The date of birth
```

It would be much better to write the above line of code as 
follows:

```csharp
string birthday;
```
