# Switch Statements

## Learning Objectives
- What <b>switch statements</b> are.
- The <b>default</b> keyword.
- What <b>expressions</b> are.
- <b>Why</b> switch statements?

## Expression
- Any piece of code that evaluates to a value.
- It can be a variable or function call.

## Switch Statement
- A code block that allows us to execute one of 
several code branches, depending on the value 
of an <b>expression</b>.
- In a switch statement, each branch of execution 
is labelled `case`.
- A `case` can have multiple lines of code.
- Each `case` must end with a `break;` 
statement.

## Why Switch Statements?
- They are shorter and more readable, once we 
learn how they work.

## The `default` Branch
- When we chain multiple `if/else` statements, 
we often have a final `else` block, which 
executes if all conditions failed.
- The `default:` block/branch in a switch 
statement serves the same purpose. 
- It is executed if the result of the result of 
the <b>expression</b> does not satisfy the conditions 
required to execute any other branch/block in the 
switch statement, i.e., does not match any of the 
cases.
