## Assignment Overview
You will create a simple calculator. It will 
allow the user to input two numbers and a 
character representing the operation to perform 
on the two numbers (i.e. addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division). The program will 
then print the operation and the result on the 
screen.

## Application Workflow
<b>1. When the application first starts, it 
shall print:</b><br>
Hello!<br>
Input the first number:

<b>Then the user will input a number. for now 
we <em>let the application crash</em> if the user 
enters an invalid input for number. Then the 
program will print:</b><br>
Input the second number:<br>

<b>Then the program will ask:<br>
What do you want to do with the numbers:<br>
[A]dd<br>
[S]ubtract<br>
[M]ultiply<br>
[D]ivide<br>
</b>

The user will then enter A for add, S for 
subtract, M for multiply, or D for divide.<br>

<b>The application should handle the input  according to 
the table below<b/><br>

<b>Finally, the application should “Press any
key to close” and close after the key press.</b><br>

## Selection Options
|Scenario|User Action|Result|
|:-------|:---------|:-------|
|Addition|User enters ‘A’ or ‘a’ into the console.|The application prints something like <b>5 + 10 = 15</b> to the console, assuming the first number was 5 and the second 10.|
|Subtraction|User enters ‘S’ or ‘s’ into the console.|The application prints something like 5 - 10 = -5 to the console, assuming the first number was 5 and the second 10.|
|Multiplication|User enters ‘M’ or ‘m’ into the console.|The application prints something like 5 * 10 = 50 to the console, assuming the first number was 5 and the second 10.|
|Multiplication|User enters ‘D’ or ‘d’ into the console.|The application prints something like 5 / 10 = 50 to the console, assuming the first number was 5 and the second 10.|
|Incorrect or empty input|User does not select any option (empty choice), or the selected option is not valid.|“Invalid option” is printed to the console.|
