# Introduction to Exceptions

## Learning Objectives
- What are exceptions?

## Exceptions
- Exceptions are they way C# represents runtime 
errors.
- If the runtime encounters an issue that it cannot 
manage then it throws an exception.
- If the code does not handle the exception, then the 
application will simply crash. This is because the 
application will not know how to continue.
- There are numerous cases whereby exceptions will be 
thrown. Examples are; division by zero, an attempt to 
remove an element from a collection that is empty, 
accessing a variable that is `null` (has not been 
initialized with a value), etc.

## Task
- Run the program in the previous section.
- Simulate the user entering a value that is not a 
number.
- Study the runtime exception that is thrown.
- How can we handle the possibility of the user 
providing an invalid input in this program?
