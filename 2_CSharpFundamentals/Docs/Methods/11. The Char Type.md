# Char Type
- As opposed to the `string` data type, which 
represents an <strong>array</strong> of characters,
the `char` data type represents a <em>single</em>
character.
- A variable that represents a single character is
declared using the keyword `char`, for example:

```
// Declare/define a grade variable and initialize
// it with an empty character:

char grade = '';	

// Assign a value to the grade variable:

grade = 'B';
```

- Note that a `char` value is always enclosed in
<em>single</em> quotes, unlike a `string` value
that is always enclosed in double quotes.
- With this in mind, convert the grades method to 
return a `char` instead of a `string`. How does 
this improve the code?
