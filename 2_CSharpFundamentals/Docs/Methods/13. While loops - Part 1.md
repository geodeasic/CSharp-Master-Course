# While loops - Part 1
- A while loop is a code block that is executed
repeatedly until a specified condition (which must
evaluate to `true` or `false`) is met.
- In the following code listing, the <em>expression</em>
must evaluate to a Boolean value. The while loop 
terminates (execution jumps out of the while loop) 
when `expression` evaluates to <em>`false`</em>.

```
while(expression)
{
	// Do something
}
```

- Example
```
int number = 0;

while(number <= 5)
{
	number = number + 1;
	Console.WriteLine($"The value of number is {number}");
}

Console.WriteLine("The loop finished because the value of number became greater than 5.");
```
