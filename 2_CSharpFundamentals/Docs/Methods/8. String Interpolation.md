# String Interpolation

## Learning Objectives
- What string interpolation is and how to use it.

## String concatenation - The old way
- We combine strings by adding them using the plus operator:

```
int a = 4, b = 2, c = 15;

Console.WriteLine("The first is " + a + ", the second is " + b + ", and the third is " + c + ".");
```

## String interpolation - The new way

- You must add a `$` sign before the opening quote.
- Embed variables within curly braces inside the string.
- You can perform an operation or call a method within the curly
braces. The result of the operation or method call 
will be added to the interpolated string.

```
int a = 4, b = 2, c = 15;
Console.WriteLine($"The first is {a}, the second is {b}, and the third is {c}.");
```

- String interpolation makes the code easier to read
and write.
- It helps to reduce chances of making mistakes 
such as forgetting to add a space or comma.
- You can use Visual Studio's quick refactoring menu to 
convert a concatenated string into an interpolated one.
