# Coding Exercise - String Interpolation

Using string interpolation, implement a method 
named <b>FormatDate</b> in which, given three 
integers representing the year, month, and day, 
returns a string in the format 
<b>DAY/MONTH/YEAR</b>.

### For example:
- When `day` is 30, `month` is 10, and 
`year` is 2024, it shall return `"30/10/2024"`.
- When `day` is 05, `month` is 04, and 
`year` is 1901, it shall return `"05/04/1901"`.
- Test your method using `Console.WriteLine();`

Consider the following method signature in your 
implementation:

```
string FormatDate(int day, int month, int year)
{
	// Your implementation goes here.
}
```
