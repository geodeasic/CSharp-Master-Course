# Capturing User Input from the Console
## Reading User Input from the Commad Line
- Use the statement `Console.ReadLine()` to read user input 
from the command line.

## What are Code Snippets?
- Command line code snippets allow you to reduce the 
amount of typing you have to do in order to call a 
function at the command line.
- For example, instead of typing `Console.WriteLine()`, 
you can type the two letters `cw` and hit `Tab` twice to 
get `Console.WriteLine()`.
- The complete list of code snippets cab be found

## What is the Role of Compiler Warnings
- Warnings, unlike errors, do not cause compilation to fail.
- However, they are suggestions to you by the compiler 
on how to do things better.
- Therefore, it is wise not to ingore them.
