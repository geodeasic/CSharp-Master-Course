# Naming Variables
- Variable names cannot be reserved words (such as `int`, `class`, etc.). 
A collection of all C# key words can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/).
- Adding the "@" sign before the variable name bypasses the 
restriction of not using a key/reserved word as the name of 
a variable, for example:<br>
```
int @class = 5;
```
## Variable naming rules
1. Names can contain letters, digits, and the underscore (_) 
sign.
2. The first character of a variabl name cannot be a digit.
3. Variable names are case-senitive, thus the variable names 
`count` and `Count` are refer to two different variables.
4. Variable names should be in <b>Camel</b> case when combining 
words to form a name, for example:

```
decimal myMoney = 100.00;
```

```
string @int = "My name";  // Valid
int number30 = 30;	// Valid
decimal my-Decimal = 1.0;	// Invalid (dash not allowed)
```
# Reserved/Keywords

# Clean Code
1. Avoid abbreviations in naming variables.
```
DateTime bd;	// Bad
DateTime birthDat;	// Good
int fe;	// Bad
int firstElement;	// Good
```
2. Be precise and meaningful
```
string name1;	// Not meaningful
string firstName;	// Makes sense
```
3. Refactor your code and rename variables when it makes sense 
to do so. 
# Shortcut for Renaming Elements in Code
To rename a variable that has been used in multiple places, 
place the cursor on the variable, press and hold the 
`Ctrl` key and hit the `R` key three times. All usages of the 
variable are highlighted. Type a new name for the variable 
and press `Enter`.
