# AND and OR logical operators
## Learning objectives
1. AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators
2. What <b>short-cirtcuiting</b> is

operators
4. How to <b>name</b> Boolean variables

## Logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators
- Note that `&&` and `||` both use double characters. 
They are distinct from the binary `&` and `|` 
operators, which are out of scope for this topic.
- Use the logical `&&` operator to check if <em>more than 
one condition</em> has been met. <em>All</em> conditions 
being checked <em>must</em> be met for it to return 
`true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

```csharp
var number = 10;
var isGreaterThan4AndLessThan9 = number > 4 && number < 9;
```
In the above code, the value of the variable
`isGreaterThan4AndLessThan9` will be `false` because 
the first part of the operation returns `true` but 
the second part returns `false`.

- Use the lgical `||` operator to check if <em>at 
least one</em> of the conditions is met.
- Use the logical `&&` to check if <em>both</em> of the conditions 
are met.
- You can have more than two of the operators in a single 
expression:
```
int number = 10;
var isEqualTo2OrGreaterThan200OrLessThan250 = 
	number == 2 || number > 200 || number < 250;
```
